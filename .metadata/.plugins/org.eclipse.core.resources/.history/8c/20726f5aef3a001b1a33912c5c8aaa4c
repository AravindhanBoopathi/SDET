 * 
 * Problem 1 as of 12/10:
 	
Shortest form of array with rank

Sample input#1: 

input : [10,2,1,4,10,2,5,13,5]

output : 
1) you should get all the duplicates form of array first 
	[10,2,1,4,10]
	[2,1,4,10,2]
	[5,13,5]

2) then you should cut down to [5,13,5] (here all have same repetitions in the array thats why we are going with less count)

3) final output should be: 
[5,13,5] with rank 2 (rank is repeation of digits in the shortest array)

Sample input #2: 

input : [2,1,2,3,5,3,3]

here output should be [3,5,3,3] with rank 3 

the most preference is rank than array size.
